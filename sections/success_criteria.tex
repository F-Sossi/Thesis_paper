Success is defined in three tiers to keep evaluation concrete and measurable.

\textbf{Minimum Criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At least two pooling or fusion strategies implemented and runnable in DescriptorWorkbench.
    \item Baseline results reported on HPatches with the same evaluation protocol used throughout the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple descriptor families evaluated under identical keypoint conditions.
    \item Clear evidence of when pooling or fusion improves mAP and when it does not.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aspirational Criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A reproducible configuration set that others can use to compare new descriptors.
    \item Findings that generalize beyond a single descriptor pair (e.g., both SIFT-family and CNN-family).
\end{itemize}

Quality is measured by accuracy (mAP), robustness across HP-V/HP-I splits, and the computational cost of the proposed configurations.
