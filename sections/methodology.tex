The project methodology follows these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literature review and descriptor selection:} Identify descriptors and pooling strategies from the literature.
    \item \textbf{Implementation:} Implement selected descriptors and pooling strategies.
    \item \textbf{Optimization:} Improve performance and efficiency of the implementations.
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking:} Evaluate pooled descriptors against established benchmarks using precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

This structure keeps the evaluation focused and comparable across configurations.
