\section{Goals/Vision}

This research aims to make descriptor fusion and pooling decisions data-driven rather than anecdotal. The goals are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clarify when pooling helps:} Evaluate pooling and stacking strategies for local descriptors under controlled conditions, including descriptor family (SIFT, CNN) and keypoint selection strategy.

    \item \textbf{Quantify trade-offs:} Measure accuracy gains against dimensionality and runtime costs, using consistent evaluation protocols on HPatches.

    \item \textbf{Enable reproducible comparisons:} Implement and document configurations in DescriptorWorkbench so results can be re-run and extended.

    \item \textbf{Establish practical guidance:} Translate empirical results into concrete recommendations for descriptor choice, normalization, and fusion.
\end{itemize}

The broader motivation is to replace ad-hoc fusion choices with evidence: when combining descriptors helps, why it helps, and when it does not.

\subsection{Stakeholders and Beneficiaries}
The immediate beneficiaries are researchers and engineers who must choose between descriptor families or fusion strategies under real constraints (accuracy, speed, and memory). This applies to applications such as SLAM, SfM, image retrieval, and visual place recognition.
