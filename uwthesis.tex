% CLAUDE EDIT: Updated abstract 2025-12-07 to reflect actual research findings
Local feature descriptors are fundamental to many computer vision applications including SLAM, structure-from-motion, and image retrieval. This thesis investigates the fusion of descriptors from different detector families---traditional (SIFT) and learned (KeyNet)---through spatial keypoint alignment.

We present three main contributions. First, we demonstrate that keypoint scale control dramatically improves matching performance: filtering SIFT keypoints to the top 25\% by scale yields a 39\% relative improvement (17.7 absolute percentage points in mAP), while similar filtering for CNN descriptors yields 21\% relative improvement. Second, we identify and explain why classical-CNN descriptor fusion fails: the incompatible value distributions (non-negative SIFT versus zero-centered HardNet) cause averaging to destroy learned representations, resulting in 6.7\% degradation versus using HardNet alone. Third, we show that CNN-CNN fusion succeeds when distributions are compatible: concatenating HardNet and SOSNet descriptors at scale-matched intersection keypoints achieves 93.4\% mAP on the HPatches benchmark, the highest result in our study.

Our spatial intersection methodology enables descriptor fusion by establishing 1-to-1 correspondence between keypoints from different detectors using mutual nearest neighbor matching with configurable tolerance. We develop DescriptorWorkbench, an open-source evaluation framework implementing the metrics from Bojanic et al. (2020), and conduct 108 experiments across 99 descriptor configurations. The results demonstrate that keypoint quality---scale and detector agreement---has greater impact on matching performance than the choice of fusion strategy.
